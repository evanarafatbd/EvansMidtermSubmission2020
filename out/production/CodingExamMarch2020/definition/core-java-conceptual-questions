Explain the entire java life cycle.

Ans: All source code is first written in plain text files ending with .java. Those source files are
then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler. The .class files contains byte codes that the
JVM can read. Then the class loader runs your application in JVM. EX: Code/text Editor > source file >
java compiler > byte code > class loader > bytecode verifier > interpreter > then prints.

what is class?
Ans: Class is like a blue print of an object.

What is object?
Ans: Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: The "main method is the entry point"
Why main is static?
Ans: So the compiler can call it without an object being created of it. Its for easier accessability
reasons.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Ans: The Object class is the super class of all classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Ans:Path is an environment variable it is used by the operating system to find the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans: The abstract class can only be extended once where the interfaces can be implemented multiple
 times.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans: No you cannot make an object out of Interface and Abstract classes. They must be extended or
implemented by a concrete class.

what is Access Specifier?
Ans: It controls the access of a class, methods, constructors and variables.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans: OOP stands for Object Oriented Program.
1. Encapsulation: is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users by declaring "private".
2. Inheritance: is the process of Inheriting variable, methods and other fields from a parent class
   by either extending a class or implementing an interface.
3. Polymorphism: means using methods and fields inherited from other classes and using the same methods
   to perform different tasks multiple times. Meaning they can take on many forms.
4. Abstraction: is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to
   the user. It is done by naming a class or interface Abstract.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Ans: A Java package organizes Java classes and classes in the packege can access each other private
     attributes, methods. java.lang and the current package is automatically imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans: API stands for Application Programming interface. (Scanner, Class, List, Maps, HashMaps, System etc..)

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Ans: Java does support multiple inheritance by interface only!

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: Overloading is when two methods have the same name but different parameter. It happens in the
"Compile time".

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans: occurs during execution. It is performed by using the try..catch method to wrap a program with
just in case there is an error the application wont crash on you.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans: static keyword is used for memeory management. static variable and methods are constant meaning
they will always be the same. Static method must be used with static variable.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans: final is a access modifier. It is used when you are declaring a constant class, method or other
attributes.
What is final, finally and finalize?
    final: is a access modifier. It is used when you are declaring a unchangeable method or variable,
     final class cant be inherited. It cannot be changed by other user.
    finally: is used with the try..catch exception handling. Codes in the finally bracket will be
    executed no matter what. regardless if the exeception handling occurs or not.
    finalize: is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
Ans: initializes a newly created object. A constructor must have the same name as the class!

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Ans: Yes. You can have as many as you need. Java automatically creates a default constructor for you
with no parameter accepted.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Ans: the default constructor created by Java.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans: it is a reference variable in java. It can be used to refer instance variable of current class.
It can be used to invoke or initiate current class constructor. It can be passed as an argument
in the method call.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
Ans: it is used inside a subclass to call upon a method or constructor in the parent class.

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans: Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
Ans: JVM is not independent. it is used to both translate the bytecode into the machine language
for a particular computer, and actually run the corresponding machine language instructions as well.

What version of java are you using?
Ans: java version 1.8.0_241.

What is JAR stand for ?
Ans: Java ARchive. it is used for data archiving, data compression and decompression etc...

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
Ans: JDK is a development kit which provides java libraries w/ necessary components to run java code.
     JVM is the Java Virtual Machine which provides the environment to execute byte codes and actually
     executes it.
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
Ans: JDK is for development purpose whereas JRE is for running the java programs. JDK and JRE both
contains JVM so that we can run our java program. JVM is the heart of java programming language and
provides platform independence.

What is compile time and run time?
Ans: Compile-time is where the code you entered is converted to executable code.
While Run-time is the where the executable is being ran.

What is heap?
Ans: it is the run time data area where objects are stored and also destroyed if unnecessay to make
space in the memrory.
How java manage it's memory?
Ans: by using the java garbage collector which deletes objects thats unnecessary to save memory space.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
What is Singleton class?
Ans: is a class that can have only one object created of it. To do that make that class constructor
private.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
when to use transient variable in java?
Difference between while and do..while loop?
Ans: while loops check the condition first, if true it will run the function. Do...while loops will run
the function atleast once and then check to if the condition given is true if no it will not run it again.

What is Enum?
Ans: Enum is a special class created when you want constant (Unchangeable) variables and functions.
to declare a enum class just type the word enum in the class.

What is Iterator?
Ans: is an interface in java.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Ans: Integer.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
Ans:
What is constructor chaining in Java?
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
What is JIT stands for?
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
what is multithreading in java?
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
What is Framework?
What are the testing Framework available in java?
Difference between jUnit and testNG?
What are the dependencies for this project?
Ans: go to file intellij, click project structure, then click dependencies to view all of them.

what is dependency injection in java?
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
